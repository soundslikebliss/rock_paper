##Problem:
###Write a command line script in python that will play Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock).

The program should take as input one of the five choices (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, or spock), pick one at random for the computer to play, and pick a winner.  Example output:

* $ python rpsls.py
* your move: paper
* I played: spock
* paper disproves spock, you win!
